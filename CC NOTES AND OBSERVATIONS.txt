// These are my personal notes from the experience of various CP problems

1.> Minimum number of parts N can be divided so that its pieces can be combined to form any number from 1 to N = log2(N) + 1;
   
	FOR EG:- N = 5;
		5 -> 1,2,2  (3 Parts)
		1 = 1
  		2 = 2
		3 = 1 + 2
		4 = 2 + 2
		5 = 1 + 2 + 2
2.> If there is a set of number and we have to find an optimal number (say x), such that sum of absolute differences of the nummbers of set
from x is minimum. Then that optimal number x is median of that sorted set.

	FOR EG:- Given a sorted array arr of size n, where i denotes index of that array
		 F(x) = MIN{ summation(abs(arr[i] - x) }   where, 1 <= i <= n and x is median of array arr
			
3.> If we are given an array all initially zero. Now we are given Q querries with range updates in the array then one way is to use Lazy Propagation in segment trees and the other
way is below.
	
	FOR EG:- Suppose our array arr[] = 0 0 0 0 0 0 (6 elements)
		Now 3 querries
		update 100 in range [1,3]
		update 50 in range [2,5]
		update 10 in the range [5,6]
		then final array is
		100 150 150 50 60 10
	
		Other method of doing it is:-
		suppose we have to update X in the range [a,b], then update X in arr[a] and -X in arr[b+1]
		and then use prefix sum of the array to find final array
		
		Reference: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/constant-time-range-add-operation-array/
		 
		Overall time complexity of this algo is T(Q + N), where Q is the no. of querries and N is the size of array


4.>        ********* TIP := If any formula is given in a DP question then try to deduce and simplify that formula and then think of the approach *********

5.> Suppose we have two numbers A and B
	where, A = p1^a1 * p2^a2 * p3^a3 * p4^a4 ..... 		where p1, p2, p3 are prime factors of A
	       B = q1^b1 * q2^b2 * q3^b3 * q4^b4 .....		where q1, q2, q3 are prime factors of B
	then, numbers 	G = p1^(a1%2) * p2^(a2%2) * p3^(a3%2) * p4^(a4%2) .....
		 and  	H = q1^(b1%2) * q2^(b2%2) * q3^(b3%2) * q4^(b4%2) .....

		if(G == H) then this means product of numbers A and B will give a number which is a perfect square.

6.> If gcd(a,b) = 1 then:

	gcd(a*b,c) = gcd(a,c)*gcd(b,c)

	otherwise: 	 gcd(a*b,c) = gcd(gcd(a,c)*gcd(b,c),c)

7.> If diophantene equation: ax + by = c has solution then c must be divisible by gcd(a,b)
		
8.> gcd(a,b) = gcd(a-b,b) = gcd(a%b,b) where a >= b

9.> Burnside Lemma: It is used to count distinct objects w.r.t to symmetry.

	Ref: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/orbit-counting-theorem-or-burnsides-lemma/

10.> For small linear recurrence relation we can use Matrix Exponentiation to solve for nth term in O(log(n)*k^3)
	Linear Recurrence:  F(n) = C1.F(n-1) + C2.F(n-2) + C3.F(n-3) + .... + Ck.F(n-k)
	
11.> Area of the n sided regular polygon is given by A = 1/2 * p * a , 		
						where p = perimeter of polygon
						a = length of apothem .i.e., perpendicular line segment from centre of polygon to a side
		On solving further, 	A = l*l*n / 4tan(pi/n) 	, 	where l = length of side, n = number of sides

12.> According to Pick's theorem, Area of polygon with integer coordinate vertices A = i + b/2 - 1
										where, i = integer coordinates lying strictly inside the polygon
										       b = the number of points lying on polygon sides
